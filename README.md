# Advanced Playlist Manager-hk
Java project that manages music playlists using ArrayLists and LinkedLists. It includes features to add, insert, remove, shuffle, and retrieve songs, as well as sort them by title, artist, or duration. Songs can be searched by their attributes, and the project uses a queue to track the last five songs played. It provides two playlist implementations (PlaylistArrayList and PlaylistLinkedList) and an interactive menu for managing playlists, viewing recently played songs, and switching between playlist types. The deliverables include the source code for all classes, test cases for each feature, and an analysis of the time and space complexities of the operations. 

# Analysis of Time and Space Complexities:
This playlist manager system uses both ArrayList and LinkedList, each with its strengths and weaknesses. ArrayList is faster for accessing songs because it stores data in a continuous block of memory, so getting an element takes constant time (O(1)). However, adding or removing songs in the middle of the list can be slow (O(n)) because the other elements need to be shifted. On the other hand, LinkedList is better for adding or removing songs, especially at the beginning or end, because it just updates pointers (O(1)). But finding a song in a LinkedList is slower (O(n)) because it needs to go through each element one by one.  

For searching songs by title or artist, both lists take the same time (O(n)) since they must check each song in the list. The recently played queue performs well, as adding songs and maintaining its size limit happens quickly (O(1)). Overall, ArrayList is a good choice when you need to access songs often, while LinkedList is better when youâ€™re making many changes to the list. This system lets you switch between them, offering flexibility based on how you want to use the playlist.
